# Gameshell

`icons` contains different icons for consoles/games, all collected from the clockworkpi forums. None are made by me and credit goes to the respective creators - I've put them here for two reasons:

1.  Have them all in one place
2.  Being able to download them directly from the Gameshell without having to use a second system and SCP

`retroarch` contains automation for the [tutorial of @fr500](https://forum.clockworkpi.com/t/retroarch-megathread/716)

- `retroarch.cfg`, with audio, video, input & folder setup
- `setup.sh` a bash script to automate the retroarch build and setup

## Usage

1.  SSH into your Gameshell
2.  Run `bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hpcodecraft/Gameshell/master/retroarch/setup.sh)`
